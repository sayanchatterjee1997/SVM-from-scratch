# SVM-from-scratch
Support Vector Machines from Scratch and Nonlinear Decision Boundary using SVM 
Learning Objective:
1.Implement SVM from scratch
2. Visualize nonlinear decision boundary using SVM

Summary:
Objective: To implement Support Vector Machines from scratch and find nonlinear decision boundary (when required)
• Implemented Support vector machines classifier on some linearly separable data from scratch (by using numpy)
• Performed feature extraction techniques to obtain nonlinear decision boundary for not linearly separable datasets
